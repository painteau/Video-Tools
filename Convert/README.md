## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Batch Encoding (ALL-2*)
1. Place all videos in the `ORIGINAL/` folder.
2. Run the corresponding `ALL-2*` script.
3. Encoded files will be saved in the `OUTPUT/` folder.

### 2️⃣ Drag & Drop Encoding
1. Drag a video file onto the respective script.
2. The file will be encoded and saved in the **same directory** as the source.

### 3️⃣ Video Merging
1. Place all videos you want to merge in a single folder.
2. Run the `SimpleVideoMerger.cmd` script.
3. The tool will automatically merge all files into a single video.
